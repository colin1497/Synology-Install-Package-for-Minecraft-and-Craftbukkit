# Synology-Install-Package-for-Minecraft-and-Craftbukkit
A package to allow you to run a Minecraft server on your Synology NAS

History

I wanted to set up a private Minecraft server for my son.  I found work by patters at:

Unfortunately it hadn't been updated in about 2 years, but from the comments it was apparent that people were still
using it and manually updating the files.  Well, BLECH!  I decided to try to clean it up because, well, I'm a glutton
for punishment.


Compatitibility, Java, etc.

Honestly, any Synology machine that has the power should be OK, and I'm not able to tell you if yours is one of them.
As of now, I'm using a RS814+ with DSM 5.1 and the Java VM published by Synology.  patters also has Java packages at:

I won't pretend to know what's right for you.
